        "It is a branch of mathmatics concerned with the analysis of decision-making and strategy. It is applied in economics,biology and behavioral science. Game theory is used to determine different strategy to compete with one another. Game theory is also used in everyday life to make decision like when to change lanes in traffic, when to cross the road or even when to do your assignment.\n",

        "Imagine buying a truck from a dealership.\n",
        "\n",
        "You want to buy the truck and want to get the best price. The dealer has a fixed price beyond that he can't drop without making a loss. The truck dealer bases his discussion tactics on the fact, you want the truck, which he can sell the truck to another buyer that he will win praise for and the break-even point beyond which he cannot negotiate down.\n",
        "\n",
        "You base your discussion tactics on the fact that dealer wants to sell the truck, that there is a profit margin into which you can bargain to bring truck's price down, and are mindful that the dealer knows your presence in his office means you want to buy a truck.\n",
        "\n",
        "Every time we interact with another person, whether it is eyeing up the last donut at the store, or doing a favour for co-worker that we will hope will be repaid in kind. This logic that we use could be explained using the rules of game theory.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other word, game theory can also be defined as the mathmatical study of decision-making, of conflict and strategy in social situations."
